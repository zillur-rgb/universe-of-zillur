        My target is to build things following the latest trend and
        technologies. And definitely my other primary goal is to find solutions
        for the problems. Grasp for limitless learning brought me to web
        programming. Because I love exploring new things and in web development
        there is no end of learning. Currently, I am learning NextJS and also
        have a thirst for learning GraphQL and Redux.

      <p className="text-lynch leading-7 my-6">
        Beside coding I usually love to read the documentation of different
        things. I also like to listen to audio stories in my free time. Another
        thing I love to do is biking. I love to explore the city with my bike.

        Currently, I am looking for an opportunity as a frontend developer in

        relocate as well.
